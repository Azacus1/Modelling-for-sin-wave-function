# Modelling-for-sin-wave-function
A comprehensive TensorFlow script that guides through creating, training, and evaluating a model to predict sine wave values. It meticulously processes data, builds and optimizes a Keras model, visualizes results, and converts the model for efficiency using TensorFlow Lite, both quantized and non-quantized.
